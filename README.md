## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/M/MTN-logo-459AAF9482-seeklogo.com.png">
*This project dealt with an MTN data problem that involved an upgrade to
the infrastructure sytems.

*I was tasked with coming up with a data based approach to the recommedation system

in inorder to identify high priority areas, services and customers so that MTN would prioritise them in their 

upcoming upgrade.

*This project details in length how I approached this problem and came up with several recommendations based on

the data. 

*The project goes from Data Loading, Data Cleaning and understanding while exclusion and inclusion procedures are 

outlined. I use the CRISP DM Methodology to approach the project.

*The CRISP DM methodology helps break down the problem statement  into bits which are then 

 relatively easier to approach.

## Data Used

* The data used over the course of this project is provided by MTN and can be accessed

 from my project documentation.

* There ae 6 datasets, 3 of which are Telecom datasets while 1

 is a cell geographical data set. 

* The other 2 datasets are simply descriptions of column names

  and general data glossary. 

## Technologies Used

* Used Google Colab as my work environment.
 
* Google colab is a great tool to implement the Data Science project since it is
   
  easier to link with resources and platforms such as GITHUB.

## Support

*Contact Nelson Muteti : nelsonmuteti012@gmail.com for any clarification.

*In addition, you may feel free to fork this project and make useful collaborations.
